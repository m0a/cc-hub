/**
 * A pane has no `scroll` until it has a terminal runtime. herdr leaves restored
 * panes runtime-less on purpose: it defers the agent resume until a client
 * attaches with a non-zero size.
 *
 * cchub used to read a missing `scroll` as "herdr server is older than protocol
 * 16" and refuse the subscribe. That misdiagnosis deadlocked exactly the panes a
 * subscribe exists to revive — no subscribe → no client size → no resume → still
 * no scroll — and blamed a fully up-to-date herdr for it. Version skew has its
 * own accurate source (HerdrUpdateService reads the real protocol number), so a
 * missing scroll must degrade to the client's size rather than throw.
